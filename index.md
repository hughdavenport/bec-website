**About me**

I was raised in Nelson, and after persuing other endeavours I returned to my roots in 2010. I then completed a Bachelor of Applied Social Science (Counselling) in 2015 through Waikato Institute of Technology and Nelson Marlborough Institute of Technology.

I use psychodynamic psychotherapy with individuals, which looks at the bigger picture of lived experiences that create our innate responses (both physical and emotional); this way of healing seeks to discover root causes and to heal through each layer.
I use Imago therapy with couples, which is a unique way of working as the focus is on the space between: the relationship itself, rather than on each individual. Imago teaches a new way to communicate, understand and build one another up within the relationship and creates deeper bonds for long lasting love.
